Run RSA.py using: python3 RSA.py
Once running, you will be presented with 4 options;
1 - create a key file, makes a file to store the keys used for encryption and decryption (REQUIRED)
2 - load a key file, loads the keys generated from option 1 into the current execution of the program (REQUIRED)
3 - encrypt file, encrypts a file using the keys currently loaded. If no keys loaded, shows an error
