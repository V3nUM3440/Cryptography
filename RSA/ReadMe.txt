## Synopsis

Python implementation of RSA algorithm

## Contents

ReadMe.txt - readme file for RSA algo
RSA.py ----- File containing functions for the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm (refer to usage section)
Report.pdf - Report for details on RSA algo, among other things

## Dependencies

Python Libraries - random

## RSA.py Usage

Run RSA.py using: python3 RSA.py
Once running, you will be presented with 4 options;
1 - create a key file, makes a file to store the keys used for encryption and decryption (REQUIRED)
2 - load a key file, loads the keys generated from option 1 into the current execution of the program (REQUIRED)
3 - encrypt file, encrypts a file using the keys currently loaded. If no keys loaded, shows an error
4 - decrypt file, decrypts a file created from option 3 using the keys currently loaded. If no keys loaded, show an error

## Version Information

17/JULY/2022 - initial version of RSA Algo
